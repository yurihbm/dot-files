# This file is use to run the Flatpak Neovim package.
#
# I opted to create a separate script instead of using an alias, as this approach
# prevent the terminal emulator's tab title from have brwap process binary and arguments
# in it.
#
# With this script, the tab title will simply show "nvim" or whatever title
# the nvim instance sets with the `vim.opt.titlestring`.
